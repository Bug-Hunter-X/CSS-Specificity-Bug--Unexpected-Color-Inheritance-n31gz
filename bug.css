The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order:

```css
.container {
  width: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.container p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

.container .inner {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.inner {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.container .inner p {
  color: green;
}
```

The issue lies in the unexpected color of the paragraph within the `.inner` class when `.container .inner` is present.  Intuitively, you might expect the paragraph to be green, based on the `color: green;` rule within `.container .inner p`. However, the cascading and specificity of CSS lead to the paragraph inheriting the `color: blue` from the `.container p` rule.
